Package

*Package in Java is a mechanism to encapsulate a group of classes, sub-packages, and interfaces

*A package is a container of a group of related classes where some classes are accessible or exposed and others are kept for internal purposes. We can reuse existing classes from the packages as many times as we need them in our program

* We use Packages in order to avoid name conflicts. 

*There are two types of packages in java:

1. User-defined Package (Create Your Own Package’s)
2. Built-in packages are packages from the java application programming interface that are the packages from Java API for example such as swing, util, net, io, AWT, lang, javax, etc.

Execute a Java program using Terminal on a Mac, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Write Your Java Program**: Create a Java source file with a `.java` extension using a text editor. For example, you can use TextEdit, Sublime Text, Atom, or any other text editor of your choice. Save your Java file with a `.java` extension.

2. **Open Terminal**: Open Terminal on your Mac. You can find Terminal in the Applications folder under Utilities, or you can use Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space) to search for it.

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Java file is located. For example, if your Java file is on the desktop, you can navigate to the desktop by typing:
   
   cd Desktop

4. **Compile Your Java Program**: Once you are in the directory containing your Java file, use the `javac` command to compile your Java program. For example, if your Java file is named `MyProgram.java`, you would type:

   javac MyProgram.java

   If there are no errors in your code, this will generate a bytecode file named `MyProgram.class`.

5. **Run Your Java Program**: After successfully compiling your Java program, you can run it using the `java` command followed by the name of the class containing the `main` method (without the `.class` extension). For example, if your main class is named `MyProgram`, you would type:

  
   java MyProgram
  

   This command will execute your Java program, and you should see the output in the Terminal window.

That's it! You've successfully executed a Java program using Terminal on a Mac. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system before proceeding with these steps. You can download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website or by using a package manager like Homebrew.
